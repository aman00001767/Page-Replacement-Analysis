Page Replacement Algorithm Performance Analysis

Project Overview

This project implements and analyzes various page replacement algorithms used in operating systems. The primary goal is to compare the efficiency of FIFO, LRU, Optimal, LFU, and Clock algorithms using performance metrics such as page faults, execution time, and hit ratio.

The project integrates algorithmic implementation (Module 1) with visualization (Module 2) to provide a comprehensive performance analysis (Module 3) through tables and graphical representations.

Features
